## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time using the fetch API and I learned how to use it to get data from an API and display it on the page. 

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = async () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I will learn more about APIs and integrate them into my projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - MDN contains a lot of useful information about web development.
