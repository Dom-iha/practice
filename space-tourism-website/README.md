### What I learned

```html
<!-- to display a different image based on screen size -->
<picture id="launch-image" class="launch-image">
                <source 
                    media="(max-width: 50em)"
                    srcset="images/technology/image-launch-vehicle-landscape.jpg"
                >
                <img src="images/technology/image-launch-vehicle-portrait.jpg" alt="Launch vehicle">
            </picture>
            <picture hidden id="capsule-image" class="launch-image">
                <source 
                    media="(max-width: 50em)"
                    srcset="images/technology/image-space-capsule-landscape.jpg"
                >
                <img src="images/technology/image-space-capsule-portrait.jpg" alt="Space capsule">
            </picture
            <picture hidden id="spaceport-image" class="launch-image">
                <source 
                    media="(max-width: 50em)"
                    srcset="images/technology/image-spaceport-landscape.jpg"
                >
                <img src="images/technology/image-spaceport-portrait.jpg" alt="Spaceport">
            </picture>
```
### Continued development
