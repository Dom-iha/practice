### What I learned

still working on it


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
   color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
   console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.


### Useful resources

-  [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn) - This helped me get started with react and understand the basics. I'd recommend it to anyone trying  to learn.
-  [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - MDN contains a lot of useful information and is a great resource for learning about web development.
