This Repository contains a collection of practice projects I used to learn while also showcasing my frontend development skills.

## What and why

What:

- This repository contains solutions to various frontend coding challenges that I attempted.
- I used each one of these projects to practice new technologies and or concepts I learned in my web development journey.

Why:

- I decided to create this repository to document my progress and revisit solutions I wrote earlier in my journey.
- I believe it shows how much I have improved since I started learning web development.
