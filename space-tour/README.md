## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) - for routing
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - For styles

### What I learned

I learnt to use react router for routing.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I will be furthering my knowledge in react and using react router to build more complex applications.
